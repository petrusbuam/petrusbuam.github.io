<h1 style="text-align:center"><u>INTRODUCTION</u></h1> 
<h2><u>1.1 Origin of C:</u></h2>
<p> In 1970 a programmer, Dennis Ritchie, created a new language called C.</p>
<ul>
	<li> The name came about because it superseded the old programming language he was using:B.</li>
	<li> C was designed with one goal in mind: writing operating systems.</li>
	<li> The language was extremely simple and flexible, and soon was used for many different types of programs.</li>
	<li> It quickly became one of the most popular programing languages in the world.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Features of C</h3>
<ul>
<li> <b>Fast and Efficient:</b> Programs written in C are efficient and fast. This is due to its variety of data types and powerful operators.</li>
<li><b>Portable:</b> C is highly portable. This means that programs once written can be run on another machines with little or no modification.</li>
<li><b>Function and Rich Libraries:</b> C program is basically a collection of functions that are supported by C library. We can also create our own library.</li>
<li><b>Modularity:</b> Modular programming is a software design technique that increases the extent to which software is  composed of separate parts, called modules.</li>
<li><b>Easy to Extend:</b> In C, new feature can be added at any time by programmer.</li>
<li><b>Case Sensitive:</b> It is a case sensitive language, that it can differentiate the character is upper case or lower case.</li> 	
</ul>
<h2><u>1.2 Install Compiler</u></h2>
<p>List of some good IDE + Compiler for C.</p>
<p><b>1. Code::Blocks with Mingw.</b>(We Recommend this) <u>Download Link:</u> <a href="http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads">http://www.codeblocks.org/downloads</a>
<u>Available on:</u> Windows, Linux, Mac.(It's free)</p>
<p><b>2. Dev C++ with Mingw/GCC.</b> <u>Download Link:</u><a href="http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html">http://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html</a>
<u>Available on :</u> Windows(it's free)</p>
<p><b>3. Xcode</b> <u>Download Link:</u><a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/">https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/</a> 
<u>Avilable on:</u> Mac.(it's free).</p>
<h4><u>What is Compiler?</u></h4>
<p style="background-color:yellow"> A compiler is a computer program that transforms human readable source code of another computer program into the machine readable code that a CPU can execute.</p>
<h4><u> What is Interpreter?</u></h4>
<p style="background-color:yellow"> An interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e performs, instruction written in a programming or scripting language, without previously compiling them into a machine language program.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Interpreter Takes Single Instruction as input.</li>
	<li>No Intermediate Object Code is Generatted.</li>
	<li>Interpreter execute conditional control statements at a much slower speed.</li>
	<li>Memory Requirement is less. Every time higher level program is converted into lower level program.</li>
	<li>The interpreter can immediately execute high-level programs, thus interpreters are sometimes used during the development of a program, when a programmer wants to add small sections at a time and test them quickly.</li>
</ul>
<h2><u>1.3 Structure of C Program</u></h2>
<ul>
	<li>C is a case sensitive language. C Program consist of one or more functions.</li>
	<li>One function that must be present in every C program is main() this is the 1st function called up when program execution begins.</li>
</ul>
<h4> <u>C program basically consist of the following parts:</u></h4>
<ul>
	<li>Preprocessor Commands</li>
	<li>Functions</li>
	<li>Variables</li>
	<li>Statements & Expressions</li>
	<li>Comments</li>
</ul>

<h2><u>1.4 Hello World Program</u></h4>
<p>Let's write c program to print <b>Hellow World</b>.</p>
<h4>PROGRAM CODE</h4>
<pre><p style="background-color:white">/*Program to print a Hello world*/
//header file
#include< stdio.h >
//main function
int main()
	{
		//Output statement
		printf("Hello World");
//returning value to function
return 0;
}</p></pre>
